Provenance Proof for KRANTI2K26
================================

Author: Dev V Joshi
Repository: devjoshi2005/KRANTI2K26
Branch: main
Recorded date (UTC): 2026-02-10T00:00:00Z
Recorded SHA-256 (sample/sample.html): bcd4c802d0cf58c6001e93ea46f8412a268f85f554cdb1349082168d516188b5

How to verify:
- Open `sample/sample.html` in a browser and click the small watermark badge at bottom-right — the script will compute the page SHA-256 and compare to the recorded value.
- Or compute locally with: `sha256sum sample/sample.html` and compare the hex string to the recorded SHA-256 above.

Notes:
- This is a lightweight provenance watermark embedded in the project files. For stronger legal evidence, commit this file and the watermark metadata to your git history and, if available, sign `PROOF.md` with your GPG key.
